        <p><bold> Our Mission:</bold> The mission of Word of Life International, Inc. (WOL) is to end hunger in the South Bronx and its surrounding communities by providing short and long-term services that foster a stronger community.</p>

<p>Our Vision: WOL envisions a community without the threat of hunger, able to support and sustain itself. </p>

<p>WOL was launched in 2003 at a modest level supported by individual contributions of time, money and food by members of Word of Life Christian Fellowship International. Within months of opening, the program began to attract thousands of people and the demand grew well beyond the Church’s initial expectations.  This explosive growth was caused by referrals from: current and former clients, from New York City Agencies, Food Bank for New York City, City Harvest, and other churches in the area.  

In 2007 WOL became an independent public charity. With the collaboration of various partner agencies, we have proved to be a significant resource in the South Bronx community.

The Word of Life International (WOL) is a multi-service community outreach center that serves as a last resort for food, clothing and social services for South Bronx residents.WOL has worked hard to establish key partner relationships; these partners supply food staples for the food pantry and soup kitchen while others provide counselors for WOL’s education and referral programs. 

The South Bronx continues to be the poorest and most at-risk community in the City.  In the zip code where WOL operates, over 42% of families and 45% of individuals live below the poverty level.  A majority of WOL’s HIV/AIDS clients are undocumented immigrants. Three-quarters of the seniors served have complicated medical conditions.  Access to opportunities such as jobs, stable housing and consistent medical care is very limited.  </p>
