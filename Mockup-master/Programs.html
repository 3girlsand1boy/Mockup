                <p>
                    We work in partnership with Universities, Colleges, Middle/High Schools and several Youth Development Organizations to provide the youth opportunities for empowerment, community service, leadership development and academic support. Every week several youth (including special education students) are engaged in different activities that benefit both the participants and the community. The objective is to provide a safe and warm environment where youth  feel welcome to engage in  skill-building services that will positively impact their career aspirations and  create a community link between  generations and  support our program services.

        <p>
                    In partnership with City Harvest For New York City provide food support to families specifically for children 19 years and under Monday through Sunday. The objective is to offer nutritious meals to under-served youth in the South Bronx and to create a safe, healthy environment for youth to turn to during the summer.

            <h3 class="secondary-header">Nutrition Training</h3>  <!-- secondary header-->
                <p>
                    We provide nutrition training to children and parents because the populations we serve have a high rate of obesity and diabetes. The program goal is to help clients know how to use the products and produce we provide at the pantry. It encourages positive eating behaviors by helping increase nutrition-related knowledge and changing skills, attitudes, and practices. Families learn together to prepare meals, learn about foods that will positively impact their health, and discover ways to stretch their dollars so they don’t go hungry. The overall objective is to reduce the high rate of obesity, diabetes and other health-related problems that is affecting a large portion of our community; to educate and empower each family to change potential life-threatening habits in a manageable, unique manner and to get to the source of all health related issues and create solutions for a healthier South Bronx.
